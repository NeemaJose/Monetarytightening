SUMMARY:

This project analyzes the global impact of monetary tightening—the process by which central banks increase interest rates or reduce money supply—particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The study contrasts the monetary loosening measures taken after the GFC with the policy tightening that began around 2015.

Key Focus Areas:

Understanding the causes and impacts of the 2008 financial crisis.

Analyzing how countries like the US, Europe, Japan, and emerging markets (e.g., India, China) responded with monetary loosening.

Studying the effects of interest rate hikes on key indicators: GDP growth, inflation, employment, asset prices, and equity markets.

Evaluating the vulnerabilities faced by emerging economies due to U.S. monetary policy normalization.


Findings:

US: Achieved inflation targets; monetary tightening led to stable growth but impacted employment and equity markets.

Europe: Continued easing due to low inflation and high unemployment.

Emerging Markets: Faced risks like capital outflows, increased debt servicing, currency depreciation, and reduced policy flexibility.


Methodology:

Secondary data analysis using sources like TradingEconomics, FTSE indices, and financial journals.

Empirical and explanatory study using economic indicators.


Conclusion:

Monetary tightening yields mixed results: while it stabilizes mature economies like the U.S., it creates financial stress in emerging markets due to their high dependence on foreign capital and rising debt levels.
